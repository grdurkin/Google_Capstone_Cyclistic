# Google_Capstone_Cyclistic

I created this code, in R, to complete my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification through Coursera.

#Project Details
This project comes from a fictitious bike-share company out of Chicago, Cyclistic bikes.
I was a junior data analystic tasked with analyzing the company's data in order to find how members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
This analysis was to be used to make recommendations for new digital marketing strategies that would target casual riders in hopes of converting them to members.
